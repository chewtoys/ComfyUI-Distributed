# Problem: custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Distributed/__init__.py uses relative imports
# (from .distributed import ...) that fail when pytest tries to import it as a
# standalone module during Package.setup() for the root package node.
#
# Fix: patch Package.setup() to skip the root-package's __init__.py import.
# All actual package context is provided by each test module via
# importlib.util.spec_from_file_location with synthetic stub packages.
